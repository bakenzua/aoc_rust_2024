# Advent of Code 2024 in Rust

My progress with [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) whilst trying to learn rust.

See the description of the puzzles at <https://adventofcode.com/>.
Many thanks to Eric Wastl for providing these challenges.

# Goal

Use Advent of Code to have fun and learn some Rust!

## Puzzle data files

As of the Advent of Code rules, the puzzle inputs are not included this repo.

A data folder needs to be present, with files in the format `example_1.txt` and `input_1.txt` with numerics changed for advent day. Otherwise please change the hardcoded filepaths in `src/day_*.rs` files.
